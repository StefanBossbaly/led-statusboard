# Rustic Pixel Display

This project is currently a work in progress. The goal of this project is to build a driver for
RGB LED matrices that displays things like real time location, transit, stocks and various other
relevant information. The eventual goal is to have a plugin system that will allow other developers
to write their own plugins. Currently the project has an embedded HTTP server that allows for configuration.
